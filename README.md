# TrEP: Transformer-based Evidential Prediction for Pedestrian Intention with Uncertainty

Welcome to the official repository for the TrEP project, as presented at AAAI 2023. This project focuses on leveraging transformer-based models for predicting pedestrian intentions with an emphasis on handling uncertainty in the predictions.

## Publication

The details of our approach and findings are thoroughly documented in our paper. You can access the paper through the following links:

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment manager.

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zzmonlyyou/TrEP.git
   cd TrEP

2. Create and activate the Conda environment:

  ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate TrEP-env
```
   This will install all the necessary dependencies as specified in environment.yml.

3. Training the Model
  ```bash
   python train.py
```
   The arguments and their descriptions are documented within train.py. Adjust them as per your requirements.
