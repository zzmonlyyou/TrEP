# TrEP: Transformer-based Evidential Prediction for Pedestrian Intention with Uncertainty

Welcome to the official repository for the TrEP project, as presented at AAAI 2023. This project focuses on leveraging transformer-based models for predicting pedestrian intentions with an emphasis on handling uncertainty in the predictions.
